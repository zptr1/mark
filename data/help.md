## What are these markov chains?!?!1
**Markov chains** can generate silly and funny messages based on your messages.

Markov chains are trained on your messages, but do not worry â€” I don't store any of your messages in their original form.
What I store instead is all word pairs you've said: for example, if you say "I like cats", I will store these two pairs: "I like" and "like cats".

## How can I get my own markov chain?
You can use {setup} to create your markov chain! 
After creating your markov chain and sending some messages, use {generate} to generate a message!
You can use {config} to enable or disable your markov chain everywhere/on a specific server.

## I don't trust you!!!
If that helps, you can see all the data the bot stores about you using {download my data}.
Or delete it with {delete my data}.
