## What are these markov chains?!?!1
**Markov chains** can generate silly and funny messages based on your messages.

Markov chains are trained on your messages, but do not worry â€” I don't store any of your messages in their original form.
What I store instead is all word pairs you've said: for example, if you say "I like cats", I will store these two pairs: "I like" and "like cats".

## How can I get my own markov chain?
You can use {config enable globally} to enable your markov chain on **all servers** with you and me!
Alternatively, you can use {config enable here} if you want to enable your markov chain **only on this server**.

Also, if you want to enable your markov chain everywhere but disable it on one server, you can use {config disable here} on that specific server!
You can use {config disable globally} to disable your markov chain later. Disabling your markov chain does not delete its data, so you can re-enable it later when you feel like it.

Use {generate} to generate a message after you've enabled your markov chain and sent some messages!

## I don't trust you!!!
If that helps, you can see all the data the bot stores about you using {download my data}.
Or delete it with {delete my data}.
